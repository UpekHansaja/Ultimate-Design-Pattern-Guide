# Q: 

## Scenario:
You are developing a Travel Booking application where users can create custom Holiday Packages. Each holiday package can include:
    - Flight tickets
    - Hotel Accommodation
    - Airport Pickup
    - Sightseeing tours
    - Travel Insurance

However, not every customer wants all of these options. Some may only want a flight and hotel, while others may want everything.
You're currently using a constructor to create Holiday Package Objects, but it has become unmanageable due to the growing number of parameters and their optional nature.

## Tasks:
    1. Identify and explain the design problem in the current approach.
    2. Explain how the Builder Design Pattern can solve this issue.
    3. Design a Java-based solution using Builder pattern to allow flexible and readable construction of various holiday packages.
    4. Draw the class diagram based on your design.
    5. List advantages of using Builder in this context.
