# Meal Ordering System

## Scenario:

You're building an app for a fast-foot restaurant where customers can customize their meals. 

Each Meal may include:
    - Burger
    - Drink
    - Fries
    - Dessert, Sause or other optional items

Building such an object using constructors can quickly become messy due to many possible combinations.
