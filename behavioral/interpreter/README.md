# Introduction to Interpreter Design Pattern

The Interpreter Design Pattern defines a representation for a language's grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language. 

It is used to:
 - Interpret expressions of a simple language.
 - Convert sentences into abstract syntax trees and evaluate them.

## Characteristics of Interpreter Pattern

 - Defines a grammar for a simple language.
 - Includes classes for each grammar rule (Terminal and non-terminal expressions).
 - Recursively interprets expressions.
 - Often used in compilers, query languages, calculators, etc..
 - Easy to extend with new rules.


## Key Components of Interpreter Pattern

## Advantages
 - Easy to add new grammar rules.
 - Great for small domain-specific languages (DSLs).
 - Recursive structure matches grammer naturally.
 - Encourages modular class design.

## Disadvantages
 - Complex grammars become hard to manage.
 - Many small classes can clutter the codebase.
 - Inefficient for performance-critical parsing (applications).
 - Difficult to use for full programming languages.
