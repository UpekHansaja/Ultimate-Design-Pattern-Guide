# Smart Home Command Interpreter

## Background Scenario:
You are a part of a software team developing an intelligent voice assistant for a smart home automation system. Users can give voice commands in natural language such as:
 - "Turn on kitchen lights"
 - "Turn off bedroom fan"
 - "Increase temperature by 5"
 - "Decrease temperature by 3"

To process these commands,  your system first converts the voice into text. However, now you need to parse and interpret these textual commands into actions that the system can execute.
Rather than hardcoding each command with if-else statements, your architect suggests using the interpreter design pattern to improve maintainability and extensibility.

**Task:**
Design a command interpreter system using the Interpreter Design Pattern to handle user commands for the smart home.
